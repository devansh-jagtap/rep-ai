A detailed overview of Envoy for marketing, sales, and partner materials.

---

## Executive Summary

**Envoy** is an AI-powered SaaS platform that lets professionals and businesses create **personal AI representatives** that work 24/7. Users get:

- **AI portfolio sites** — Publish a portfolio (or connect an existing site) and attach a conversational AI agent that represents them.
- **Lead generation & CRM** — The agent qualifies visitors, captures leads, and stores them in a simple CRM with conversation history.
- **Conversion insights** — AI-generated insights on visitor behavior and conversion patterns.
- **Embeddable chat** — Deploy the same agent on a portfolio page or as a standalone embed.

Envoy turns a static portfolio or website into a **conversational front door** that answers questions, matches the owner’s tone, and captures qualified leads automatically.

## Product Name & Positioning

- **Product name:** Envoy  
- **Tagline (current):** *Your 24/7 AI representative.*  
- **One-liner:** Envoy helps you build personal AI agents that generate leads and showcase your skills, even when you’re offline.

**Positioning:** Envoy is for individuals and small teams (freelancers, consultants, agencies) who want a professional presence that works around the clock—without hiring a sales or support team. The AI agent acts as a representative: it speaks in the user’s voice, uses their knowledge, and qualifies/captures leads for follow-up.

## Target Audience

1. **Freelancers & consultants** — Designers, developers, writers, marketers who want a portfolio that engages visitors and captures project inquiries.
2. **Job seekers & students** — People who want to stand out with a dynamic, AI-powered portfolio (supported by the free Starter plan).
3. **Agencies & small teams** — Teams managing multiple portfolios or client sites, with need for lead capture, analytics, and optional custom domains.
4. **Anyone with an existing website** — Users who already have a site and want to add an “Agent Rep only” (chat/lead capture) without rebuilding the whole site.
